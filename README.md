The original bikeshare project was created in December of 2021. This README file is also being created in December of 2021. They are both for a Udacity nanodegree course called Programming for Data Science.

### Udacity Bikeshare Project
This is for the Udacity Bikeshare and GIT projects

### Bikeshare information and stats
The project allows a user to select between bikeshare data for 3 different cities including Chicago, New York City, and Washington. They can also choose to view the data for a specific month that data is available for or a specific day. The user provides input for each of these fields and then a number of interesting data points are shared specific to the subset of data that was selected. The user also has a chance to look through some of the raw rows of data if they would like to.
