### 12/21/2021
The original bikeshare project was created in December of 2021. This README file is also being created in December of 2021. They are both for a Udacity nanodegree course called Programming for Data Science.

### Udacity Bikeshare Project
This is for the Udacity Bikeshare and GIT projects

### Bikeshare information and stats
The project allows a user to select between bikeshare data for 3 different cities including Chicago, New York City, and Washington. They can also choose to view the data for a specific month that data is available for or a specific day. The user provides input for each of these fields and then a number of interesting data points are shared specific to the subset of data that was selected. The user also has a chance to look through some of the raw rows of data if they would like to.

### Files used
The files used for the bikeshare project included a starting template version of bikeshare.py as well as .csv data files for each of the cities included in the project.
For the GIT project an existing Udacity repository was forked.

### Credits
Some of the code for the bikeshare project was provided starting off in the template that was provided. There were a couple points in the project that I wasn't sure how to write the code for what I was trying to do and google searches were helpful. One example of this was using iloc to be able to specify specific rows to show a subset of raw data.
